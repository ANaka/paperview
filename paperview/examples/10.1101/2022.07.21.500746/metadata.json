    "abstract": "Developing valid tools that assess key determinants of canine healthspan such as frailty and health-related quality of life (HRQL) is essential to characterizing and understanding aging in dogs. Additionally, because the companion dog is an excellent translational model for humans, such tools can be applied to evaluate gerotherapeutics and investigate mechanisms underlying longevity in both dogs and humans. In this multi-center, cross sectional study, we investigated the use of a clinical questionnaire (Canine Frailty Index; CFI; Banzato et al., 2019) to assess frailty and an owner assessment tool (VetMetrica HRQL) to evaluate HRQL in 451 adult companion dogs. Results demonstrated validity of the tools by confirming expectations that frailty and HRQL deteriorate with age. CFI scores were significantly higher (higher frailty) and HRQL scores significantly lower (worse HRQL) in old dogs ([&ge;] 7 years of age) compared to young dogs ([&ge;] 2 and < 6 years of age). Body size (small < 25lbs or large > 50lbs) was not associated with CFI or total HRQL score. However, older, larger dogs showed faster age-related decline in HRQL scores specific to owner-reported activity and comfort. Findings suggest that the clinician-assessed CFI and owner-reported VetMetrica HRQL are useful tools to evaluate two determinants of healthspan in dogs: the accumulation of frailty and the progressive decline in quality of life. Establishing validated tools that operationalize the assessment of canine healthspan is critical for the advancement of geroscience and the development of gerotherapeutics that benefit both human and veterinary medicine.\n\nGraphical abstractGraphical summary of the design, results, and conclusions of the study.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=179 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/500746v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (41K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d70950org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a4748borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@df6892org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14a7aed_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",
